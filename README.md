# Twiice - Simplified management and development

**Twiice** is a project born of the difficulty faced by small businesses
enterises to manage themselves daily. Many management tools exist
currently, but do not allow small businesses to fill their
needs, often complex and very singular.

**Twiice** brings **a simple solution** to manage a company, capable of
adapt easily to the business problems of any TPE.

**Twiice** gets closer to what an ERP can do, while being modular
and easily customizable.

## Openings and possibilities

**Twiice** is an open project. This means that it tends to want to adapt to any need formulated by a TPE (At first).

Here are the points that can be covered by Twiice, hypothetically of the creation of modules:

*  Project management
*  CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
*  Content Management System (CMS)
*  Inventory management
*  And so on ...


**Twiice**, it is the real need formulated by the companies to find a tool adaptable to their specificities. At the current stage,
it is akin to a **Framework ++** setting up a solution for managing various data.

## How to ?

In first place, **Twiice** is intended for small digital businesses, or small businesses outside this business bubble,
accompanied by a person who is familiar with the field of web and development. From there, it is possible to learn to develop and understand
the Twiice project, through our **WIKI** as well as our automated scripts.

**And after ?**

Twiice wants to see further. Being still a young project, it is limited to light technical needs to develop its own data management software.
However, in the near future, **Twiice** wants to make itself available to all, and offer a simple graphical interface to automate developments
going through "Graphic" development directly in the software. **It will no longer be necessary to code!**.

### Open Source Project

Twiice is a project whose sources are open to allow you to make your contribution.
Any contribution is welcome, as long as it contributes to the continuous improvement of the initial project. The goal is
to use the skills of all to provide a qualitative tool.

In order to contribute, it is necessary to follow the development guidelines and adapt to the structure
of the project.

### Create your own modules

**Twiice** offers many possibilities, but also gives you the right to create your own solutions.
Do you need your own **CRM** ? Twiice allows you to create it. Do you want to create a specific **CMS** ?
Twiice brings you the essentials. A **standard module** does not suit you? Adapt it without crushing the
main code of the project.

**Twiice** is built around the framework [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), so everyone can contribute
and simply create his **own modules**. Do not hesitate to contact us directly for any suggestion
improvement.
